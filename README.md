<h1 align="center">☠️</br>Bones UI</h1>
<br>

Custom React component library inspired by [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui), [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) and [Primer React](https://github.com/primer/react).
The library contains a set of pre-configured react primitive components, such as `Flex` and `Box`, which can be easily styled by passing props, as also seen in Chakra UI, Materiasl UI and Primer React.
